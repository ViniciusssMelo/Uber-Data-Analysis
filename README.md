# Uber-Data-Analysis
Data analysis on UBER's data of ride calls from travellers  I used simple Python(panda and seaborn) functions to get really useful insights from the data. After analysing the data we got the following output results:
- Generated the map of the place where data belongs to;
- Generated heatmap of the user requesting for rides over the week; 
- Generated the hourly, day wise, weekly and monthly plots of user requests; 

Although it was not told in the data that to what place the data belongs to, but still I was able to get the location of the place where data belongs, it was Manhattan. Also I did some additional analysis going deeper on the data.
